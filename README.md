# WFSSBackgrounds
Create WFSSBackgrounds for JWST NIRISS WFSS Observations from available data. 

This repository contains scripts to create NIRISS WFSS Backgrounds from all available public data. These can be used while the NIRISS team works on creating improved backgrounds files for CRDS. Presently, the existing backgrounds leave systematic structure after subtraction, particularly noticeable closer to the ecliptic plane where the absolute background level is higher. 

The backgrounds created using this code are all available on Zenodo. If you find these backgrounds helpful or have any improvements you'd like to add, please let me know via email or pull-request. If you use these in published scientific work, please credit this repository and the Zenodo Dataset. 

## The Process

## Potential (Short-term) Improvements
1. More refined source masking.
2. Image smoothing.
3. Better removal of
